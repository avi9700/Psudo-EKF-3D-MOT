To make the estimation more robust, especially over the long term, while considering object size variations and accurate estimation of velocity and orientation (vx, vy, theta), we need to incorporate several advanced techniques into the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). These techniques focus on addressing issues like drift in estimates over time, handling uncertainties more effectively, and maintaining accuracy even when the object undergoes significant changes.

Techniques for Long-Term Robustness:
Adaptive Noise Covariance:

Over time, the uncertainties in process and measurement models might change. To address this, you can make the process noise covariance (Q) and measurement noise covariance (R) adaptive. For instance, if you notice that the velocity estimates are becoming less reliable, you might increase the uncertainty in the corresponding elements of Q.
Adaptive Kalman Filters adjust these covariances dynamically based on recent measurement residuals (innovation).
Drift Correction Using Periodic Reinitialization:

In long-term tracking, drift in position, velocity, or orientation can occur. Implementing a periodic reinitialization or reset mechanism based on certain conditions (e.g., when the uncertainty becomes too high) can mitigate drift. This involves recalculating or resetting the state vector to ensure it remains close to the true state.
Incorporating a Model of Environmental Dynamics:

If the environment or the object has predictable dynamics (e.g., a car moving along a road), incorporating a model of these dynamics can improve long-term robustness. This could involve adding a motion model specific to the object's environment or using map-based information to adjust predictions.
Using a Sliding Window or Fixed-Lag Smoother:

A fixed-lag smoother or a sliding window filter can be employed to revisit and correct past estimates based on more recent observations. This technique helps to correct for errors that become evident only when more data is available.
It allows the EKF to use a limited history of states and measurements to provide a more refined current estimate, thus reducing the impact of outliers or sudden changes.
Multi-Model Adaptive Estimation:

Use multiple models simultaneously (e.g., different motion models) and adaptively select or fuse the results based on which model currently fits the observed data better. This can be useful if the object alternates between different types of movement (e.g., straight-line motion vs. turning).
Modified EKF Implementation with Long-Term Considerations
Here’s an outline of how the EKF can be extended to incorporate these techniques:

Explanation of Modifications:
Adaptive Covariance Adjustment:

The adapt_covariances method dynamically adjusts the process (Q) and measurement (R) noise covariances based on the magnitude of recent innovations. This helps the filter to remain accurate even when the object’s behavior changes or when noise characteristics change.
Innovation Norm Calculation:

The get_innovation method calculates the norm of the difference between the predicted and actual positions. This innovation norm is used in adapting the noise covariances, providing the filter with an internal mechanism to detect when its predictions are becoming unreliable.
Long-Term Robustness:

By dynamically adjusting the noise covariances and periodically re-evaluating the state, the filter is less likely to drift over time, making it more robust for long-term tracking.

Summary
This implementation of an Adaptive Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is designed to be robust for long-term tracking, with adjustments for both the process and measurement noise covariances based on the system's performance. It dynamically adjusts these covariances based on the innovation, helping the filter to handle varying levels of noise and changes in the object's dynamics. The filter is particularly resilient to changes in the size of the tracked object and maintains accurate estimates of velocity and orientation over time.

By integrating these advanced techniques, this filter is better suited for applications such as autonomous driving, where objects can exhibit complex behaviors over long periods, and where maintaining accuracy and robustness in state estimation is critical.
